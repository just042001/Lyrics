	Hello, it's me<br />
	I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br />
	To go over everything<br />
	They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br />
	But I ain't done much healing<br />
	Hello, can you hear me<br />
	I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br />
	When we were younger and free<br />
	I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br />
	There's such a difference between us<br />
	And a million miles<br />
	Hello from the other side<br />
	I must have called a thousand times<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
	But when I call you never seem to be home<br />
	Hello from the outside<br />
	At least I can say that I've tried<br />
	To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
	But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
